<!-- Enjoy The Outdoors - Capstone 2. -->

<!-- I tackled a challenging capstone project with a 4-day deadline. 
I prioritized getting the dropdowns, display lists, radio buttons, and mountain images working before designing the page. 
After completing these tasks, I applied skills from my previous capstone and added a video as the main background. 
Setting up the video was initially difficult, but after some online research, I managed to position it and set it to loop and autoplay. 
I applied lessons learned from my previous capstone to avoid repeating rookie mistakes. -->
